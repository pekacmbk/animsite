              September 11 attacks, series of airline hijackings and suicide attacks committed in 2001 by 19 militants associated with
              the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda against targets in the United States, the deadliest terrorist attacks on American
              soil in U.S. history. The attacks against New York City and Washington, D.C., caused extensive death and destruction and
              triggered an enormous U.S. effort to combat terrorism. Some 2,750 people were killed in New York, 184 at the Pentagon,
              and 40 in Pennsylvania (where one of the hijacked planes crashed into the ground after the passengers attempted to
              retake the plane); all 19 terrorists died (see Researcherâ€™s Note: September 11 attacks). Police and fire departments in
              New York were especially hard-hit: hundreds rushed to the scene of the attacks, and more than 400 police officers and
              firefighters were killed.
